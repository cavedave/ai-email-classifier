The following sentence is unclear: 
- 2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and add this key as a secret. If you did click on the open this in colab you have colab open already.

the following line can exist outside the method as it can be static

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash', system_instruction="Return exactly one label for the user's message.")

Images 
- Interesting way of sharing images, you are including code rather than hot linking them or putting them in the repo.
- Consider putting `DevOps` in the middle of the circular arrows
- reduce the size of the `load your key into secrets` image as it take a large portion of a page

This sentence is unclear
- But you don't consider getting your brain to learn the difference between a good/bad/urgent/valuable  invoice/request/email/sales lead training a model.
