You see, it all started about two weeks ago when I was driving to work and noticed that my car was making some strange noises. At first, I thought it was just the radio or maybe some loose change in the console, but then it got worse. The noise started to sound like something was grinding or scraping, and I got really worried. I pulled over to the side of the road and checked under the hood, but I don't know much about cars so I couldn't really tell what was wrong. Anyway, I managed to get it started again and drove it home, but now it won't start at all. The battery seems dead, and there are some cracks in the windshield that weren't there before. I'm not sure if these problems are related or if they happened separately. Also, I think my insurance might be up for renewal soon, so I should probably check on that too. Can you help me figure out what to do? I'm really stressed about this whole situation.",Other,rambling_001,2025-08-19
